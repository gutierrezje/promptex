## Data Fetching Strategy

**Hybrid: Webhooks + Polling Fallback**
- On subscribe: attempt to register a GitHub webhook (requires repo admin). Falls back to polling if no permission.
- Polling: uses GitHub Events API with ETag-based conditional requests to avoid wasting rate limit.
- Client-side: 60-second polling interval while tab is active.
- Stale check: if `last_synced_at` > 5 minutes old on page load, trigger background sync.
- Multi-user efficiency: events stored per-repo, not per-user. Multiple users subscribing to the same repo share one event set.
- Rate limit awareness: tracks `x-ratelimit-remaining` from GitHub responses; throttles/stops polling as limits approach.

## AI Inference Strategy

### Per-Repo Scheduled Inference (shared across users, cost-efficient)
Runs on a cron schedule (every 4 hours) per subscribed repo. Results shared across all users subscribed to that repo.

**Repo-level AI jobs:**
- **Issue triage**: Classify new/updated open issues (bug/feature/question/docs) + priority estimate
- **Label suggestions**: Batch-suggest labels for unlabeled issues
- **Repo activity digest**: 2-3 sentence summary of recent activity, shown on dashboard
- **Stale issue detection**: Flag issues with no activity in 14+ days

**New table: `repo_ai_insights`**
- `id`, `repo_owner`, `repo_name`, `insight_type` (triage/label_suggestion/digest/stale_detection), `target_issue_number` (nullable), `content` (JSONB), `model_used`, `generated_at`, timestamps
- UNIQUE(repo_owner, repo_name, insight_type, target_issue_number)

**Scheduling**: Vercel Cron (free tier: 2 cron jobs). Cron endpoint iterates subscribed repos, skips recently processed ones, runs inference sequentially to stay within rate limits.

### Per-User On-Demand Inference
Triggered when user clicks "Generate Draft" on a specific issue.

**User-level AI jobs:**
- **Response drafts**: Full draft reply to an issue
- **Assignee suggestions**: Based on user's team context

### Combined Flow
1. Cron runs every 4h -> processes repos -> stores insights in `repo_ai_insights`
2. User opens dashboard -> sees repo digests and triaged issues (from shared insights)
3. User opens issue -> sees pre-computed label suggestions (shared) + can generate personal draft (on-demand)
4. User clicks "Generate Draft" -> Gemini call -> stored in `ai_drafts` (per-user)
5. Rate limit tracking across both paths to stay within free tier

## Issue Discovery & Scoring

### Repo Scoring
Repos are scored for contribution opportunity: `high stars + low contributor count + slow avg response time = high opportunity`.
- **Data sources**: GitHub API `/repos/{owner}/{repo}` (stars, open_issues), `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contributors` (count), `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues?sort=created` (response time sampling)
- **Score formula**: `opportunity = normalize(stars) * 0.3 + normalize(1/contributors) * 0.3 + normalize(avg_response_hours) * 0.2 + normalize(open_issues) * 0.2`
- Scored during cron job. Users can also search/add repos manually; scoring happens on subscribe.

### Issue Scoring
Issues within subscribed repos scored for "contribution fit":
- **Automatic signals** (from GitHub API): `good first issue` / `help wanted` labels, comment count (low = less competition), linked PR count (0 = unclaimed), days since last activity
- **AI-assessed signals** (from Gemini during cron): has reproduction steps, has clear description, estimated complexity
- **Score**: weighted combination. High score = good candidate for contribution.

### Discovery Page (`/discover`)
- Shows top-scored issues across all subscribed repos, sorted by contribution fit
- Filters: language, label, complexity, repo
- Each issue card shows: repo name, issue title, score breakdown, labels, age, competition level (comment/PR count)

## Contribution Quality Gate

### Context-First Flow (before any draft)
When a user opens an issue to potentially contribute, they see an **Issue Context Panel**:
1. **AI Summary**: What the issue is about, what's been discussed, current status
2. **Context Checklist** (AI-assessed, user-verifiable):
   - [ ] Has reproduction steps or clear description
   - [ ] Has environment/version info (if applicable)
   - [ ] Not already being worked on (no linked PRs)
   - [ ] Not a duplicate of another issue
   - [ ] Maintainer has acknowledged / labeled the issue
   - [ ] User has relevant expertise for this issue
3. **Existing Discussion Summary**: Key points from comments so far
4. User reviews checklist. Only after engaging with context can they click "Draft Response".

### Draft Quality Gate (after generating draft)
The AI draft includes a self-assessment:
- **Value Check**: Does this response add new information vs. repeating existing comments?
- **Specificity Check**: Is this actionable, or is it generic "I can help" noise?
- **Qualification Check**: Does the response demonstrate understanding of the codebase/problem?
- Rating: Green (high value) / Yellow (review carefully) / Red (likely not valuable, reconsider)

The user sees the rating before copying/posting. Red-rated drafts show a warning encouraging the user to reconsider.

## Auth Flow
1. User clicks "Sign in with GitHub" -> redirect to GitHub OAuth
2. GitHub redirects back with code -> exchange for access token
3. Upsert user in DB, encrypt token, create encrypted session cookie
4. `_authed.tsx` layout guard checks session on all protected routes
5. Scopes: `repo` (read repos, create webhooks) + `read:user`

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Init TanStack Start project with Bun, TS strict mode, Tailwind v4
- Set up Drizzle + Neon, define full schema, run migrations
- Basic layout: `__root.tsx`, `AppShell`, `Sidebar`
- Vitest config + first schema test

### Phase 2: Authentication
- GitHub OAuth App setup
- Session config, `/login`, `/auth/github`, `/auth/github/callback`
- `getSession` server fn, `auth.middleware.ts`, `_authed.tsx` guard
- Auth integration tests

### Phase 3: Subscriptions + GitHub Sync
- `subscriptions.tsx` page, `RepoSearch`, `RepoList`
- `github.service.ts` (Octokit, rate limits, ETags)
- Subscribe/unsubscribe server fns, `sync.service.ts`
- Webhook registration + `/api/webhooks/github` with HMAC validation
- Unit tests for GitHub service + sync service

### Phase 4: Dashboard / Newsfeed
- `getFeed` server fn with cursor pagination
- `FeedList` (virtualized with `@tanstack/react-virtual`), `FeedItem`, `FeedFilters`
- Auto-refresh polling, dark Bloomberg-style theme
- Component tests

### Phase 5: Issues View
- `issues.tsx` list, `issues.$issueId.tsx` detail
- `IssueCard`, `IssueTimeline`, `IssueDetail`
- On-demand comment fetching with in-memory TTL cache

### Phase 6: Repo + Issue Scoring & Discovery
- `scoring.service.ts` - repo opportunity scoring, issue contribution-fit scoring
- `repo_scores` and `issue_scores` tables + migrations
- `/discover` page with scored issue list, filters, score breakdowns
- Scoring runs during cron + on new subscription
- Unit tests for scoring logic

### Phase 7: AI - Repo-Level Insights (Shared)
- `insights.service.ts` - batch issue triage, label suggestions, activity digests, stale detection
- AI-assessed issue signals (has_repro, has_clear_description) fed into issue_scores
- `repo_ai_insights` table
- `/api/cron.insights.ts` Vercel Cron endpoint
- `gemini.service.ts` with prompt templates and rate tracking
- Unit tests with mocked Gemini

### Phase 8: AI - Context Panel + Quality Gate + Drafts
- **Context Panel**: AI summary of issue, context checklist (repro, env, duplicates, linked PRs, maintainer acknowledgment)
- **Draft generation**: `generateDraft`, `getDrafts`, `updateDraftStatus` server fns
- **Quality Gate**: AI self-assessment of draft (value/specificity/qualification checks, green/yellow/red rating)
- `DraftPanel`, `ContextPanel`, `QualityGate` components
- User must engage with context before drafting
- Unit tests with mocked Gemini

#### Draft Philosophy & Tonal Guidelines
The goal of AI drafting is NOT to write comments for the user — it's to help them write comments that **get taken seriously by maintainers and move the conversation forward**. A technically correct comment with the wrong tone gets ignored or damages credibility.

**Core drafting principles:**
- **Epistemic humility over certainty.** Prefer "It's possible that..." / "In my testing..." / "This might be..." over "The root cause is..." / "This is definitely...". The user may not fully understand the system internals, and overconfident language undermines trust when wrong.
- **Show work, not conclusions.** A minimal reproduction with code blocks is worth more than a paragraph of analysis. The draft should prioritize concrete evidence (steps to reproduce, code snippets, environment details) over explanations.
- **Leave room to be wrong.** Always hedge speculative analysis. "My guess is X, but I haven't verified in the source" is much stronger than "X causes Y" when the user can't defend the claim in follow-up comments.
- **Match community tone.** Scan existing issue comments and match the formality level. Some projects are casual, some are formal. Never add emoji or exclamation marks unless the thread already uses them.
- **Don't over-explain.** If the reproduction speaks for itself, don't add a speculative "Possible Explanation" section the user can't back up. Less is more — a clear repro with no analysis is better than a clear repro with wrong analysis.
- **Frame contributions, not complaints.** "I found X" not "X is broken." "This might help narrow it down" not "You should fix this."

**Quality gate tonal checks (in addition to value/specificity/qualification):**
- **Certainty calibration**: Does the draft state things as fact that the user may not be able to defend? Flag overconfident claims.
- **Actionability**: Does every paragraph either provide evidence or ask a useful question? Remove filler.
- **Tone match**: Is the formality appropriate for the project? Check against existing comments in the thread.
- **Human-like writing**: Avoid patterns that read as AI-generated. No em dashes (use commas, periods, or parentheses instead). No "Furthermore" / "Additionally" / "It's worth noting" filler. No fancy unicode arrows or bullet decorations. Keep punctuation plain. Don't add a big header/title to the comment. The draft should read like a developer typed it in a text box, not like it was edited by a copywriter.

### Phase 9: Secondary Views
- `commits.tsx`, `pulls.tsx`, `releases.tsx` (filter `github_events` by type)

### Phase 10: Polish + E2E
- Loading states, error boundaries, empty states
- `settings.tsx` page
- Playwright E2E tests for all major flows
- Accessibility pass

### Phase 11: Deploy
- Vercel deployment, env vars, Neon connection, webhook URL config

## Verification
- `bun run dev` -> app runs locally, login with GitHub works
- Subscribe to a repo -> events appear in feed within polling interval
- Open an issue -> see repo-level insights (triage, labels) + generate personal draft
- `bun run test` -> all unit + integration tests pass
- `bunx playwright test` -> all e2e tests pass
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` -> no type errors
