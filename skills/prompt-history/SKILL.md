description: Extracts and curates AI prompt history into PR-ready markdown using PromptEx (pmtx). Reads AI tool session logs, correlates prompts to git scope, and renders categorized output for pull request descriptions. Use when the user asks about prompt history, wants to document their AI-assisted reasoning for a PR, or asks to extract or summarize their session.
compatibility: Requires pmtx binary installed. Run `cargo install --path .` from https://github.com/gutierrezje/promptex or see the README for other install options.

# PromptEx — Journal and Extract AI Prompt History

PromptEx (`pmtx`) reads AI tool session logs, correlates prompts to git changes in scope, and outputs structured JSON for agent-side rendering.

---

## On session start

Run once to verify your tool is supported:

```bash
pmtx check
```

- **Exit 0**: your tool's logs are captured automatically. Run `pmtx extract` when ready.
- **Exit 1**: your tool isn't natively supported yet. pmtx can only extract from supported tools (Claude Code, Codex).

If `pmtx` is not found, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

---

## Extracting

When the user wants PR-ready output, or at the end of a session, run:

```bash
pmtx extract [scope-flags]
```

This outputs structured JSON containing the curated entries. You then:
1. **Categorize** each entry into one of three sections (see below)
2. **Render** the final PR markdown — see `references/rendering-rules.md` for the full format spec

### Choosing a scope

If the user provided flags, use them. Otherwise infer from context:

| Situation | Flag |
|-----------|------|
| Feature branch | *(no flag — smart default)* |
| Mainline + uncommitted changes | `--uncommitted` |
| Mainline, last commit only | `--commits 1` |
| "Last hour / 2 hours / today" | `--since 2h` (or `1h`, `1d`, `3w`) |
| "The whole branch" | `--branch-lifetime` |
| Unsure | Ask the user |

### Categorization

Assign each entry to the most fitting section:

- **Investigation** — exploring, understanding, researching: reading code, explaining a design, asking what something does, looking into an error, comparing approaches
- **Solution** — implementing, fixing, changing: writing code, editing files, refactoring, debugging a fix, configuring something
- **Testing** — verifying, validating: running tests, checking output, confirming a fix works, writing test cases

**`assistant_context`**: the tail of the preceding assistant turn is always captured when one exists. Use it to improve categorization for any entry — not just short ones. It's especially valuable for bare confirmations ("yes", "go ahead", "looks good") and for hybrid messages that begin with approval before adding new context ("yes fix that. also check..."). For example, "yes" with `assistant_context` ending in "Should I refactor the auth module to use JWT?" is a Solution approval, not noise.

**Noise entries to drop:**
- Prompts invoking pmtx itself or asking to extract/summarize prompt history — these are meta, not development work (e.g. "extract my prompts", "add my prompts to the PR", the skill invocation turn)
- Entries with no tool calls and no files touched, unless the prompt shows significant deliberation — architectural questions, design tradeoffs, or reasoning that visibly shaped what came next are worth keeping even without artifacts
- Near-duplicate prompts (semantically the same ask, rephrased slightly) — keep the most recent version, which is usually the more refined one
- Short replies with no meaningful tool calls and no clear proposal in `assistant_context`
- Git/workflow housekeeping with no files touched — branch switches, pushes, merges, pull requests opened — these are overhead, not development work (e.g. "switch to main and push", "sorry I pulled, try again")

When in doubt, keep the entry. The user can always trim.

### Rendering

Follow `references/rendering-rules.md` for the full format spec, example output, and per-field rules.

Generate the markdown, then write it to `~/.promptex/projects/{id}/PROMPTS-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md` using your file-writing tool. Do **not** render the full markdown in chat.

**After writing the file**, post it as a comment to the open PR:

```bash
gh pr view --json number -q '.number' 2>/dev/null && \
  gh pr comment --body-file ~/.promptex/projects/{id}/PROMPTS-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md
```

Then confirm with a brief one-line summary in chat — not the full markdown:

```
✓ N prompts (X investigation, Y solution, Z testing) · Xh Ym · posted to PR #N
  Saved to ~/.promptex/projects/{id}/PROMPTS-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md
```

If no open PR is detected, skip the comment step and tell the user:

```
✓ N prompts (X investigation, Y solution, Z testing) · Xh Ym
  Saved to ~/.promptex/projects/{id}/PROMPTS-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md
  No open PR found — run `gh pr comment --body-file <path>` when ready.
```

**If the user wants to update the PR description instead of posting a comment** (confirm first — this overwrites the existing PR body):

```bash
gh pr edit --body-file ~/.promptex/projects/{id}/PROMPTS-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md
```

### Flag reference

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--since 2h` | Commits from the last duration (30m, 2h, 1d, 3w) |
| `--commits N` | Last N commits |
| `--since-commit HASH` | Since a specific commit (exclusive) |
| `--branch-lifetime` | Full feature branch since diverge point |
| `--uncommitted` | Uncommitted changes only |

## Troubleshooting

**`pmtx: command not found`**
Install the binary first:
- In the promptex repo: `cargo install --path .`
- Otherwise: see the project README for install instructions

**`0 entries` or no output after filtering**
The scope's time window may not align with your session. Try:
- `--since 2h` or `--since 1d` to widen the search
- `--branch-lifetime` to capture the full branch history
- `--since-commit <hash>` to manually anchor the window
